## Hangémon

### A hangman game to guess the Pokémon!

I wanted to make a hangman game and it was the perfect opportunity to use the official Pokémon API.<br />
Built using React with React-Bootstrap for styling.<br />
Features include badges that keep track of score and a progress bar that shows how many wrong guesses you have left.<br />
Used Redux for global state management and Redux-thunk for the asynchronous API call.
