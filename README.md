## Hangémon

### A hangman game to guess the Pokémon!

I wanted to make a hangman game and it was the perfect opportunity to use the official Pokémon API.<br />
I used React and Redux with CSS for styling.

Went back later and used redux-thunk for the ascynchronous API call.<br />
Also added the ability to track your score.
